# AnaglyphoholV2

## 2026-10-07 
AnaglyphoholV2 is released as Anaglyphohol v4. 

## CHANGE 2025-06-13 
A new repository was created for version 2 and version 1's repository was made private. 
Version 1 may be made public again at some point. That is part of the reason a separate repo was made for V2.

## Version 2 changes
- Supports video elements on compatible websites. 
- Supports recommended (listed) websites like YouTube, Twitch, TubiTV, PlutoTV, and more.
- Added support for an Anaglyphohol subscription to unlock unlimited 3D video viewing on compatible unlisted websites.
- The depth generation and rendering process has been streamlined a bit. More will be done soon.
- Depth map scaling for improved performance.
- More user adjustable rendering settings.

Anaglyphohol is a web browser extension that lets you view images on the web in anaglyph 3D. It supports green magenta, and red cyan glasses. View image search results in 3D on google.com, bing.com, and yahoo.com. Use Anaglyphohol on on almost any website. 

Anaglyphohol is developed using Blazor WebAssembly, [SpawnDev.BlazorJS.BrowserExtension](https://github.com/LostBeard/SpawnDev.BlazorJS.BrowserExtension), [SpawnDev.BlazorJS.TransformersJS](https://github.com/LostBeard/SpawnDev.BlazorJS.TransformersJS), and the amazing monocular depth estimation machine learning model [Depth Anything](https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small).

## Installing from Chrome Web Store
Anaglyphohol on the Chrome Web Store: [Anaglyphohol](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/anaglyphohol/fjbffnhfchidmfcbecccnmdedjahankc)  
  
It is recommended that you pin the Anaglyphohol extension button to the Chrome toolbar.  Anaglyphohol will create a transparent clickable icon at the top center of the webpage it loads on. Clicking this icon will toggle the UI which allows switching anaglyph modes, and toggling anaglyph mode on and off.

## Installing in development mode (bypass Chrome Store)
If you want to install your own build of Anaglyphohol or simply want to run the latest version before it is available on the Chrome Web Store, you can install it using Chrome in development mode.

- Unpack the Anaglyphohol [release](https://github.com/LostBeard/Anaglyphohol/releases) zip.
- Navigate to "chrome://extensions" in your browser
- Enable "Developer mode" at the top right
- Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you unpacked Anaglyphohol.

## Notes
Images are added to the conversion queue in the order they are found. Moving your mouse over an image will move the image to the front of the queue.

Anaglyphohol adds a border to images it identifies for conversion when enabled. 
- Orange - queued for conversion
- Green - already converted and showing the anaglyph image
- Blue - the image currently being converted
- Red - conversion failed (may requeue)
- None - Not supported (too small... less than 100x100), or not an `<img>` element.

## Known issues
- Currently only Google Chrome on Windows has been tested. Firefox desktop support is planned. 
- Some websites and images do not work. Ex. Google Photos does not work.
- Minimal user settings. Additional user settings are planned.

## Building
You can download Anaglyphohol, make changes, and build it yourself. The Blazor WebAssembly library [SpawnDev.BlazorJS.BrowserExtension](https://github.com/LostBeard/SpawnDev.BlazorJS.BrowserExtension) is used to interact with the extension APIs. If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to open an issue.

### Manifest
The extension `manifest.json` file is located in `Anaglyphohol\wwwroot` and is merged with `manifest.chrome.json` for the Chrome build and `manifest.firefox.json` for the Firefox build. This allows the use of common and browser dependent configurations.

### Debug Build
To create a `Debug` build of Anaglyphohol run `_buildDebug.bat` in the project folder. Builds for both Firefox and Chrome will be created in the `Anaglyphohol\bin\PublishDebug\` folder. The build can be loaded into Firefox and Chrome using development mode.

### Release Build
To create a `Release` build of Anaglyphohol run `_buildRelease.bat` in the project folder. Builds for both Firefox and Chrome will be created in the `Anaglyphohol\bin\PublishRelease\` folder. The build can be loaded into Firefox and Chrome using development mode. Zip files containing the extension will also be built for Firefox and Chrome.
